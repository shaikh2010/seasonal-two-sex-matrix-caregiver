# Data instructions (prairie dog)

The prairie-dog example uses USGS data (Eads 2022): https://doi.org/10.5066/P9QTWGP4

If you are not redistributing the CSVs in this repository, download them from USGS and place them in this folder, then update the file paths in `src/prairie_dog_build.py` if needed.

Expected inputs (as referenced in the script):
- `Fipronil 2018 Monthly Survival.csv`
- `Fipronil 2020 Reproduction.csv`
